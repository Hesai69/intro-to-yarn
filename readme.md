# Getting Started with Yarn

Yarn is an alternative to NPM built by Facebook in collaboration with Expononet, Google and Tilde.

Unlike NPM it "caches every package it downloads so it never needs to download it again. It also parallelizes operations to maximize resource utilization so install times are faster than ever."

Most importantly it has a cute cat.
